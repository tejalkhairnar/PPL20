1. BB 3 and 4 correspond to the while loop. BB2 avoids executing an iteration
   unconditionally by having an unconditional goto to BB4 which is the while
   loop conditional. This is different from the if-else jumps, which always seem
   to be conditional.

2. BB 5:  Outer loop induction variable initialisation
   BB 10: Outer loop conditional check
   BB 6:  Inner loop induction variable initialisation
   BB 8:  Inner loop conditional check
   BB 7:  Inner loop body + induction variable increment
   BB 9:  Outer loop induction variable increment

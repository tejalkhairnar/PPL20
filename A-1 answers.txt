1. One declaration per line. The global declaration `int Z` has disappeared and
   is not explicitly declared, but presumably it has a unique name meaning
   consistency in any access to it is preserved. For using Z, its value must be
   loaded to/stored from locals.

2. One operation per line. Temporaries are introduced whenever an operation is
   used as an intermediate component of a computation.

3. Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation. An explicit
   cast is inserted when a float is assigned to an int.

4. Reads/writes to z performed through loads to/stores from locals. A temporary
   is required for Z = Z + 1 because the result of the computation Z + 1 cannot
   be written directly to a memory location.
